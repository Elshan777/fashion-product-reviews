Explore the fashion clothes review dataset from kaggle and build two sentiment classification models:
  - Predict if the user who wrote review recommended the product or not (Yes\No)
  - Predict the start that was given by the user to the product ( from 1 to 5)

Compare the results of the two models with Spearman correlation
